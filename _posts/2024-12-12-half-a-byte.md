Intuitively, fair allocations should be in the middle of the core, and for convex games, that is precisely where the Shapley value is. If a game is non-convex but is at least superadditive, the Shapley value will still be individually rational; however, failing even that, there are situations where both fairness and rationality are not achievable at the same time; some friends are just not worth keeping.

## Other solution concepts.

Some friends might be pretty disappointed with their fair slice. A concept that minimizes the worst-case disappointment is the Nucleolus. If instead of sharing, we wish to measure the value of a person in a group, there is the Banzhaf value -- a concrete use-case that measures the voting power of individuals is known as the Banzhaf index. Some of the concepts mentioned here may not have a solution in every game, but the least-core and the pre-nucleolus will, and the list does not end there.
