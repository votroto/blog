Scheme can be a powerful scripting language. Rather than defaulting to embedded Python, it is worth at least considering a minimalistic language such as scheme.

Try the interactive example of Trutle graphics above implemented with [Hoot/Guile](https://spritely.institute/hoot/). Press *Enter* to execute, and *Shift+Enter* to create a new line.
